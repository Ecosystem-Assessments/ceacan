"],["methods.html", "2 Methods 2.1 Data", " 2 Methods 2.1 Data We initiate this project by integrating the data from Venter et al. (2016) for terrestrial stressors and Halpern et al. (2015) for marine stressors, which were both done at the global scale. We will then update whichever data are available and better than what was available globally to Venter et al. (2016) and Halpern et al. (2015). 2.1.1 Stressors 2.1.1.1 Terrestrial All terrestrial stressors currently come from Venter et al.
