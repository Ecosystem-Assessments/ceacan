# Project description

The goal of this project is to do an Canada-wide assessment of cumulative exposure to stressors that encompasses both terrestrial and marine environments in the Canadian exclusive economic zone. 


# Methods 

## Data 

We initiate this project by integrating the data from @venter2016 for terrestrial stressors and  @halpern2015 for marine stressors, which were both done at the global scale. We will then update whichever data are available and better than what was available globally to @venter2016 and @halpern2015.

### Stressors 

#### Terrestrial 

All terrestrial stressors currently come from @venter2016

# Results 

## Cumulative stressors
